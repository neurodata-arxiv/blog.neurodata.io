# Hack@NeuroData

- What: We are planning a hackathon at JHU!
- When: Sun Nov 22nd is the main event. Auxiliary hackathon for a smaller group will be help Mon-Wed of that week.
- Where: Glass Pavilion at JHU on Sunday. Mon-Wed location will likely be on the 3rd floor of Clark, unless we have too many people, in which case we will get a larger space.
- Who: Anybody is invited, please come prepared to work in teams on neuroscience data problems!
- Why: Build community, get some work done. There are lots of talented people at JHU that have or want neurodata problems, so let's get together.
